HOW I DEVELOPED THIS APPLICATION?
I developed this application by creating a full-stack system with Django REST Framework for the backend and React for the frontend. First, I set up a REST API in Django that returns a list of facts in JSON format. Then, I built a React frontend that fetches this data from the API and shows it dynamically on the web page. I pushed both the backend and frontend to GitHub for version control. The backend was deployed on Render as a web service. I built the frontend into a production bundle and deployed it as a static site on Render. Finally, I connected the frontend to the live backend API, allowing the data to be fetched and displayed in real time.


WHAT I LEARNT FROM THIS EXERCISE?
In doing this exercise, I learned the principles of how a frontend and backend are designed and connected using REST APIs. I practically learned how to make APIs using Django REST Framework, consume those APIs in a React application, and handle data in JSON format.
I also learned how to manage code on GitHub, deploy applications on cloud platforms such as Render, and make projects publicly viewable on the internet. This exercise helped me visualize real-world full-stack development and deployment workflows.
